### Project Title
Bikeshare Project (Udacity Nanodegree)

### Description
In this project data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
is used to uncover bike share usage patterns between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
I used Python to create an interactive experience in the terminal, that gives back descriptive statistics for the locations 
and time frame chosen by the user. 

### Background
Bike Share Data Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 
These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

### Dataset
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also provide the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### Files used
